Not too long ago, if you wanted a great computer it needed to be a desktop and you had to build it yourself. That&#8217;s not the case any more, but there are still some very compelling reasons to piece together a custom PC.</p><p>Desktop computing has been commoditized but doesn&#8217;t mean we all need to use commodity computers. This is my rig (TiMR) is a celebration of the DIY spirit, problem solving, and the not-quite-lost art of cable routing.</p><p>The goal of <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/tag/timr\">TiMR</a> is to be a series of articles on ExtremeTech.com where people talk about their latest computer build. Each article will walk readers through a particular build, while offering a brief explanation as to why particular choices were made. These choices don&#8217;t have to be justified or fought for, they simply reflect the research, restrictions, and goals of the PC builder.</p><h3>Examples</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/178929-this-is-my-rig-bill-howards-10000-digital-photography-workstation\">This is my rig: Bill Howard’s million-photo $10,000 digital photography workstation</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/175997-this-is-my-rig-3d-designer-rich-ackermann\">This is my rig: 3D designer Rich Ackermann</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/163320-this-is-my-rig-sebastian-anthony\">This is my rig: ExtremeTech&#8217;s Sebastian Anthony</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/140826-this-is-my-rig-extremetechs-sal-cangeloso\">This is my rig: ExtremeTech&#8217;s Sal Cangeloso</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/109099-this-is-my-rig-extremetech-reporter-ray-walters\">This is my rig: ExtremeTech reporter Ray Walters</a></li></ul><h3>Rough outline</h3><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>CPU (and CPU cooling)</li><li>Motherboard</li><li>Graphics</li><li>Storage</li><li>Memory</li><li>Power Supply</li><li>Case</li><li>Misc (optical drives, fan controllers, etc., optional)</li><li>Operating system (optional)</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>Byline (optional)</li></ul><h3>Length</h3><p>There is no minimum or maximum length, but please take enough time to explain the parts (don&#8217;t suppose every reader knows the specs of every case and power supply) and why you chose it.

A one to two line bio can be included as well.</p><h3>Process</h3><p>Interested in writing about your new rig?
